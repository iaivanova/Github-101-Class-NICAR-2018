# Github-101-Class-NICAR-2018
Materials for Github 101 for journalists taught at IRE/NICAR conference in March 2018

### Some newsrooms that share their methodologies:

* [538](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
* [ProPublica](https://github.com/propublica)
* [USA Today](https://github.com/USATODAY)
* [BuzzFeed News](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews)

### Hands on exercise

* This repo contains (data)[SAM_Exclusions_Public_Extract_2017-01-17.CSV.zip] about entities that were prohibited from receiving federal contracts as of January 1, 2017. 

  To make things easier for this class, we've pulled out a slice of that data to work with:
  
  1) A (CSV)[FEMA.csv] with all individuals and firms the Federal Emergency Managment Agency (FEMA) added to this list. 
  2) A (CSV)[FEMA_SAMnum.csv] with the unique identifier for each of those entities
  
  If you want to dig into this further, the most recent data can be downloaded [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/system-for-award-management-sam-exclusions-extract-data-package.

### Resources:

* This [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) from Github is a good introduction to the ideas and terms you'll need to know.

* An [example](https://github.com/dannguyen/simplestuff-sqlite) of how to show your work to the world if you use SQL (also a good resource if you're trying to learn SQL).

* Here's a [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to using Markdown.
